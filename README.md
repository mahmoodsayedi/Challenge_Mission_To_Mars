# Mission to Mars

## Overview

This project scrapes data from various websites to create an new webpage that highlights facts about the planet Mars. In order to complete this task, I used splinter and beautiful soup libraries to scrape the relevant data. From there, I transformed the data to a Mongo Database before uploading the data to my webpage using flask. Lastly, I used bootstrap to cleanup my webpage to make it presentable.
